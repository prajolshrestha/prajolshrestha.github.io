# Scientific Visualization
1. Basics
- Visualization Design Basics: Data abstraction, visual encoding of information
- Review of Scalar and Vector Calculus: Differential properties, external and critical points
- Data structure and acquisition techniques: Grids, Interpolation & Differentiation

2. Volume
- Indirect volume visualization: Marching cubes & Contour Tree
- Direct volume visualization: Ray Marching & Monte carlo Rendering
  
3. Flow
- Elementary, point-based flow visualization 
- line-based flow visualizaion: Numerical integration, seeding, rendering
- Surface-based flow visualization
- Topology-based flow visualization(2D & 3D): Topological skeleton, bifurcations, feature flow fields
- Featured-based flow visualization: Vortices, Material Boundaries, Lagarangian coherent structures
- Advanced Methods: Tensor visualization, uncertainity, ensembles
