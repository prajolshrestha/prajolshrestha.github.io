# Psychology: Scientific study of mind & behaviour

## Scope
- Internal Mental Events: Perception, Reasoning, Language, Visual imagery
- External Events: Behaviour, Speech

## Method
1. Main Method: Questionaries, Survey, Case Study analysis, Recording of behaviour
2. Hypothetic-deductive approach
      -> Experiments -> Hypothesis Testing -> Adjust/Construct Theories -> New Hypothesis
3. Experiments

                            (Independent variable eg. Music condition)
                                    -> Experimental Group ->
                                    |                      |    
Theory -> Hypothesis -> Experiment ->                       -> Results  
                                    |                      |  
                                    ->   Control Group    ->
                             (Dependent variable eg. No Music condition)

Example: Hypothesis: Music interferes number of word count memorization(dependent variable)
         Result: Control Group has better number of word count recall.

          Hence, It supports our hypothesis.

## Theories
1. Voluntarism:
```
Mind consists of elements assembled into higher cognitive components through "power of will".
                ie, "Will" or "voluntary effort of mind" shapes human behaviour & experience
```
2. Structuralism:
```
What is mind? => Passive agent with "mental elements"(a basic element of mind), combining according to mechanistic laws.
                  (ie, not affected through active will)
                  [ Like in chemistry: - Multiple substance added to a mixture to produce particular chemical reaction.
                                       - 44000 sensation elements (33000 visual & 11000 auditory) ]
```
3. Functionalism:
   
```
What is mind? => Stream of consiousness
                (ie, "Mental process & function" undergoing continuous flow or change (like flow of water) instead of "mental elements")

```

4. Gestalt Psychology: Whole is greater than sum of its parts. Focus more on individual conscious experience & perception of world.

```
Concious whole cannot be reduced into "list or description of their parts".
        [Like in physics: Atoms organized when subjected to field of force]

Gestalt Principles of perceptual organization:
a. Proximity
b. Similarity
c. Closure
d. Pragnanz(symmetry and order)
e. Continuity
f. Symmetry

Contribution: Perception & Learning
```

5. Psychoanalytic Psychology: Focus role of unconsious thoughts and feelings in shaping individual behaviour : Sigmund Freud

```
Mind consists of "miniature minds" that compete with eachother for control of behaviour.

3-tired of consiousness:
1. Consious Mind: Thoughts & feelings are aware & direct access [eg. Address where we live]
2. Pre-consious Mind: Thoughts & feelings are brought to awareness with effort. [eg. Trying to recall what he did on his birthday, past year]
3. Unconsious Mind: Thoughts & feelings are completely unaware. [eg. Memory of childhood abuse, traumatic experience]

ID -> Instincts (I want) (Immediate satisfiction)
EGO -> Reality (I will) (Rational solution to conflict)
SUPEREGO -> Morality (I should) (Control instincts)

Dynamic interplay between ID (impulse), EGO(Control) & SUPEREGO (Restrain).

ID tells to do it, SUPEREGO tells to restrain it & EGO fails to satisfy ether one. Welcome to the world of ANXIETY.

Q. How to reduce or redirect anxiety?
=> a. Repression: Push your thoughts and feelings out of consious awareness [ie, Try to be less aware] [but, Harmful in long term]
   b. Sublimation: Convert negative thoughts to positive [eg, Play sport hence, express your energy in positive way] [Not harmful but beware]
```

6. Behaviourism: Study of behaviour
   
```
Mind is black box. [ie, too complex & incapable of being measured in an objective and scientific way]
Behaviour is action produced by organism.

Stimulus --> Mind --> Response
          (Blackbox)

Take away: 1. No benifits to study consiousness.
           2. Learn based on Reward & Punishment.

```

# Conclusion:
- Systematically apply experiments to study mind.
