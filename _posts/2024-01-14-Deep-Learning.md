| Type of Learning | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Supervised Learning | Learning with a teacher. The model is provided with labeled examples and learns to map input data to corresponding output labels. It's like learning from a textbook with answers provided. |
| Unsupervised Learning | Learning without a teacher. The model is given input data without explicit labels and must find patterns or structure in the data on its own. It's like exploring a dataset without any prior knowledge or guidance. |
| Semi-supervised Learning | Learning with a limited teacher. The model is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data, leveraging both the provided labels and the inherent structure of the data to improve learning. It's like having some answers but needing to figure out the rest on your own. |
| Self-supervised Learning | Learning from oneself. The model generates its own labels from the input data and learns to predict some aspect of the data from other parts of the same data. It's like creating puzzles for yourself and trying to solve them to understand the underlying patterns. |
| Reinforcement Learning | Learning through interaction. The agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. It's like learning to play a game by trial and error. |
| Active Learning | Learning with guidance. The algorithm selects which data points to label, aiming to maximize learning efficiency by choosing the most informative instances for labeling. It's like having a tutor who selects the most relevant exercises for you to practice. |
