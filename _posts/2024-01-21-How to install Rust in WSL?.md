Once you have WSL installed, you can proceed with installing Rust:

1. Download and Install Rust:
```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Configure Rust Environment:
````
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
````

3. Verify Installation:
```
$ rustc --version
````

Now you should have Rust installed on your WSL instance. 
You can start using Rust by creating projects with cargo and writing Rust code with your favourite text editor or IDE.
