# Productivity & Growth
- I believe in learning by doing. Life is a "Do it yourself" project.
- Quotes are interesting, inspiring and provocative. But, it doesn't work magically by listening, writing or reading them. Quotes are not going to rescue you. You have to work on it.
- “There is nothing magic about magic. The magician merely understands something simple which doesn’t appear to be simple or natural to the untrained audience. Once you learn how to hold a card while making your hand look empty, you only need practice before you, too, can “do magic.”
- Progress is not an illusion; it happens, but it is slow and invariably disappointing. [You need to fight with patience].
