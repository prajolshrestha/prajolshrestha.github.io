# Productivity & Growth
- I believe in learning by doing. Life is a "Do it yourself" project.
- Quotes are interesting, inspiring and provocative. But, it doesn't work magically by listening, writing or reading them. Quotes are not going to rescue you. You have to work on it.
- “There is nothing magic about magic. The magician merely understands something simple which doesn’t appear to be simple or natural to the untrained audience. Once you learn how to hold a card while making your hand look empty, you only need practice before you, too, can “do magic.”
- Progress is not an illusion; it happens, but it is slow and invariably disappointing. [You need to fight with patience].

## Q. How to (Read) Learn?
```
1. Learn Theory + Math [For multiple iterations by taking notes] [Create a note-taking framework that best suits you]
2. Repeat
3. Get Intuition
4. Code
5. Go to 1. until you understand the Big Picture, then go to 6.
6. Reality check: Use your data (prior + likelihood) to inform your decision of understanding. Do I make myself clear or am I trapped in an Intelligence trap?
7. Identify Information Gap. [Difference between existing Knowledge and objective]
8. Focus on high-impact tasks. Don't get caught up in simply being busy. [Be productive, not busy]
9. Practice a lot
10. Get out of tutorial hell: Watching lots of tutorials/online courses gives you a false sense that you are making progress. [Take time to choose the right/useful tutorial only.] 
Courses are good to know what you don't know. But quickly starting a project is a practical approach to progress. 
SOLUTION: Build things with your current skill set but not so complex that you drown.
11. Spaced Repetition
12. Retrieval Practice
13. Meta-cognition (thinking about thinking)

```
1. Impatient thoughts. -> by shifting the current thought to useful thought
2. Insignificant busywork -> By self-reflecting your work
3. Necessary pain of hard work and growth -> Believe it is non-negotiable
4. Other people's judgements and each day's frustrations -> Simply ignore and be away from those types of people
5. Things that can't be controlled -> Don't try to control it
6. Mind's endless streams of doubts -> Be optimistic -> Use the 5-sec rule [count from 5 to 1 to stop a thought]

## Brain cannot differentiate between actual experience and imagined experience!
```
The brain struggles to distinguish between actual and imagined experiences due to overlapping neural pathways, intensified by emotions and sensory engagement. 
Intuition further complicates distinctions, relying on subtle cues and subconscious processing. 
Intuition, while valuable, can sometimes feel like a blend of imagination and reality, guiding decisions without clear conscious reasoning. 
Acknowledging intuition's biases & limitations is crucial. Despite challenges, the brain differentiates reality from imagination, yet intuition adds complexity. 
Understanding these dynamics enriches perception and decision-making capabilities.
