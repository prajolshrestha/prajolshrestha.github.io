# Productivity & Growth
I believe in learning by doing.

## Q. How to (Read) Learn?
```
1. Learn Theory + Math [For multiple iterations by taking notes] 
2. Repeat
3. Get Intuition
4. Code
5. Go to 1. until you understand the Big Picture, then go to 6.
6. Identify Information Gap. [Difference between existing Knowledge and objective]
7. Focus on high-impact tasks. Don't get caught up in simply being busy. [Be productive, not busy]
8. Use your data (prior + likelihood) to inform your decision of understanding
9. Practice a lot
10. Build things with your current skill set but not so complex that you drown.
11. Repeat
```
## Q. How does failure contribute to success?
```
-> It becomes super easy once you've failed a few times.
```

## Q. What and How to Ignore? Strategic Ignorance
```
1. Impatient thoughts. -> by shifting the current thought to useful thought
2. Insignificant busywork -> By self-reflecting your work
3. Necessary pain of hard work and growth -> Believe it is non-negotiable
4. Other people's judgements and each day's frustrations -> Simply ignore and be away from those types of people
5. Things that can't be controlled -> Don't try to control it
6. Mind's endless streams of doubts -> Be optimistic
```
