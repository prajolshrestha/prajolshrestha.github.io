# Study of Mind

Mind: Information processor (Represent and transform information)

### Brain Structure & Function
- The Brain:
    1. Cerebral cortex
    2. Cerebellum

    AI: Self-organizing Map
- Nervous System: 
    1. Neurons
    2. Neural Plasticity
    3. Neuro-Development
    4. Neuro-Imaging
    5. Measuring neural activity
    6. Neural connectivity
  
### Methods of Cognitive Neuroscience
- Lesioning
- Laterialization

### Sensory Nervous System: Sensation & Perception
- Olfactory System: Sense of smell
- Gustatory System: Sense of taste
- Auditory System: Sense of hearing
- Somatosensory System: Sense of touch (temperature, body position and pain)
    1. Proprioception: Sensing oneself
    2. Introception: Sensing inside world (guts, intestine...)
    3. Extroception: Sensing outside world
    - Pain
- Visual System: Sense of vision
    1. Edge detection with linear filter [prewitt, sobel filter ...]
    2. Convolutional Neural Network (apply filters for multiple rounds)
    3. Object Recognition
    4. Encoder - Decoder (Decode brain activity to natural images)
    5. Object Detection
- Vestibular (Motor) System: Sense of balance
    1. Control Theory
    2. PID Controller
    3. Brain Machine Interface (BMI)
- Vocal System: Voice and language

### Memory
External World ---> Sensory Processor ---> Short-term/Working Memory ---> Long-term Memory

- Types of Memory:
  	1. Sensory Memory
    2. Short-term Memory
    3. Working Memory
    4. Long-term Memory
- Free will: Act without external influnces
- Consciousness: Awareness of internal and external existence
    Theory:
    1. Global workspace theory
    2. Integrated information theory
    3. Damasio's theory of consciousness
         - Emotions: Collection of unconscious neural responses to int/external stimuli
         - Feeling(2nd order emotion): Arises when organism becomes aware of changes it is experiencing

    Q. Will we ever have conscious machine?
      ==> Many important algorithms has been devised, however, many additional techniques have to be descovered yet.
