# Philosophy of Ethics

- Study of morality or, good and bad.

## Main Branches
```
1. Meta-Ethics:
Deals with the nature of morality.
It explores questions about the meaning and nature of ethical terms, the nature of moral judgments, and
the objectivity or subjectivity of moral values.
Example: It asks whether moral truths exist independently of human beliefs, or whether they are socially constructed.

2. Normative Ethics:
It is concerned with the criteria of what is morally right or wrong.
It involves the development of moral standards that regulate right and wrong conduct.

Key theories:
a. Consequentialism:
    This theory suggests that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes or consequences.
    Utilitarianism, which holds that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness,
    is a well-known form of consequentialism.

b. Deontology:
    Deontological ethics argues that actions are morally right or wrong based on rules, duties, or obligations,
    regardless of the consequences.
    Example: Immanuel Kant's theory emphasizes duty and the categorical imperative.

c. Virtue Ethics:
     The role of character and virtues in moral philosophy.
      What kind of person one should be, rather than what actions one should take?

3. Applied Ethics:
    Applies ethical theories and principles to specific practical issues, such as medical, business, environmental, and bioethics.
    Analyze real-life ethical dilemmas and make decisions based on normative moral theories.

| **Aspect**            | **Loyalty**                                    | **Integrity**                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Commitment to a person, group, or cause.      | Adherence to moral principles and values.    |
| **Basis**             | Often based on relationships or mutual benefits. | Based on ethical principles and personal morals. |
| **Condition**         | Can be conditional or transactional; may end if benefits stop. | Usually unconditional; remains constant regardless of circumstances. |
| **Focus**             | Support and allegiance to others.              | Doing what is right and just.                 |
| **Potential Conflict**| Can conflict with ethical standards if supporting someone involves compromising principles. | Can conflict with loyalty if following principles means opposing those to whom one is loyal. |
| **Example**           | Supporting a friend even when they are in the wrong because of personal loyalty. | Refusing to participate in unethical practices even if it means losing a job or facing personal loss. |
| **Long-Term Impact**  | May lead to ethical compromises if loyalty is prioritized over principles. | Often leads to consistent ethical behaviour and trustworthiness. |
