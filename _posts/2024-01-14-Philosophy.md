# Philosophy
Philosophy is the systematic study of questions. The art of asking profound questions about existence, knowledge, values, and the universe, and contemplating the mysterious ideas that shape our understanding of reality. It's the compass that guides our intellectual exploration, urging us to question, reflect, and seek deeper meaning in every line of code and every concept we encounter.

1. Nihilism
```
It is the belief that life is meaningless.
```

2. Absurdism
```
Absurdism is founded on the belief that we live in a chaotic, purposeless universe and human existence has no inherent meaning.
Despite this, humans still try to find or create meaning. This paradox produces the absurd.
```

3. Existentialism
```
It is the belief that we are each responsible for creating purpose or meaning in our own lives.
Our individual purpose and meaning are not given to us by Gods, governments, teachers or other authorities.
```

4. Stoicism
```
It is the belief that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia: a well-lived life.
```

5. Individualism
```
It is the belief and practice that every person is unique and self-reliant.
