# Philosophy
Philosophy is the systematic study of questions. The art of asking profound questions about existence, knowledge, values, and the universe, and contemplating the mysterious ideas that shape our understanding of reality. It's the compass that guides our intellectual exploration, urging us to question, reflect, and seek deeper meaning in every line of code and every concept we encounter.
