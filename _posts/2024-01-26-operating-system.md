# Operating System
1. Linux:
Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
It is widely used in servers, embedded systems, and as a desktop operating system.
Linux distributions (distros) such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS package the Linux kernel with additional software to create complete operating system distributions.

3. Windows:
Windows is a series of proprietary operating systems developed by Microsoft.
The first version, Windows 1.0, was released in 1985.
Windows is widely used in desktop and laptop computers, as well as in servers and embedded systems.
Popular versions of Windows include Windows 7, Windows 10, and Windows Server editions.

Both Linux and Windows have their own strengths, features, and use cases, and users may choose one over the other based on their specific requirements and preferences.
