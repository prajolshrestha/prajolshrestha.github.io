# Computing System
1. CPU (Central Processing Unit): 
The CPU is the primary component of a computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.

2. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): 
The GPU is a specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. However, modern GPUs are also used for general-purpose computation, including tasks like scientific simulations and machine learning.

3. GPGPU (General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit): 
GPGPU refers to the use of GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks beyond graphics processing. It involves leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs to accelerate various types of computations.

4. Supercomputer: 
A supercomputer is a powerful computer system specifically designed to perform highly demanding computational tasks. Supercomputers are used for a variety of purposes, including scientific research, weather forecasting, and simulations.

4. HPC (High-Performance Computing): 
HPC refers to the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques to solve complex computational problems that require significant computational power and resources.

5. Hyper-dimensional Computing:
This term is less commonly used and may refer to theoretical or speculative concepts related to computing in higher-dimensional spaces. It could involve exploring computational models or algorithms that operate in spaces with more dimensions than traditional computing paradigms.
