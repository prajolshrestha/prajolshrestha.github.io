## Every Time I Find the Meaning of Life, They Change It
```
A humorous exploration of philosophy that illustrate the ever-evolving nature of life's meaning. It is a call for personal reflection on the things that make us human – our anxieties, our desires, our longing for belonging and purpose. Here are some key aspects of the book:

1. The Endless Path, Not the Elusive Grail: 
Forget the myth of finding a "meaning" you can tick off and say, "Done!" Instead, embrace the ongoing journey of exploring, questioning, and redefining what matters to you. 

2. Laugh in the Face of the Abyss: 
Humor becomes a shield against existential anxieties. Laughing at life's absurdities doesn't diminish their significance; it allows us to face them with courage and find comfort in the shared human experience. Think of it like dancing on the edge of the unknown, with a smile on your face.

4. Life is not a text; it's a Lived Experience: 
Don't get lost in academic abstractions. Dive into life's messy reality, build relationships, face challenges, and learn from your experiences. The lessons gleaned from everyday moments contribute significantly to the tapestry of your personal meaning. Remember, wisdom isn't just found in books; it's woven into the fabric of your life.

5. Embracing the Dance of Opposites: 
Life isn't black and white; it's a messy waltz of joy and sorrow, love and loss, certainty and doubt. Learn to hold these paradoxes without desperately seeking resolution. The tension itself can spark creativity, growth, and a deeper understanding of the human experience.

6. Finding Meaning in the Mundane: 
Don't wait for life-changing epiphanies. Notice the small joys that weave through your days – a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, a child's laughter, a moment of connection with a loved one. These seemingly insignificant moments can be deeply meaningful when savoured and appreciated. Small steps build the path to a fulfilling life.

7. You are the Artist, not the Finder: 
Meaning isn't a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered; it's a canvas you actively paint with your choices, actions, and perspectives. Take ownership of your life, make conscious decisions, and create a sense of purpose through your engagement with the world. Remember, you are the author of your own story, not just a reader of fate's pre-written script.

8. Openness to Change is Key: 
Don't cling to any one definition of meaning, as life is a constant process of change and evolution. Remain open to shifting perspectives, adapting to new experiences, and redefining your purpose as you learn and grow. Your meaning is not a stagnant pond, but a flowing river, evolving with the currents of life.
